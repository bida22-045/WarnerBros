                <p><h1>ABOUT US</h1> 
                    Velma is an American adult animated mystery horror comedy television series that was based on the character Velma Dinkley from the Scooby-Doo franchise. Developed and created[1] by Charlie Grandy for HBO Max, it stars executive producer Mindy Kaling as the voice of the titular character, with Sam Richardson, Constance Wu and Glenn Howerton in supporting roles. Grandy also serves as the showrunner of the series. It revolves around Velma Dinkley and the other human members of Mystery Inc. before their official formation, making it the first television series in the franchise to not feature the character Scooby-Doo.

                    The series premiered on January 12, 2023. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the voice acting, but were divided toward the humor and criticized its meta storytelling, characterization, and departures from the Scooby-Doo mythos. Audience reception was overwhelmingly negative.
